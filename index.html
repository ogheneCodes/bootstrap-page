                <p>School libraries in Nigeria do exist in some secondary schools but 
                    many almost in name because all the elements required for them to operate 
                    effectively are not put in proper place. Some head teachers convert parts of the
                     libraries into classrooms, staffroom or where staff meetings are held without considering 
                     whether such will be conducive for learning (Ofoade, 1993). School libraries in some schools
                      are run by non-academic staff or full time teachers 
                    who lack library training skills and this do not augur well 
                    for school library development.
